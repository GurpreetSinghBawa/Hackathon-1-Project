# Hackathon-1-Project
A website for selling/buying books from seniors or juniors

This is a web-based marketplace for buying and selling used textbooks, specifically designed for the GITAM University community. The website allows users to list their books for sale along with the asking price, and provides contact information so interested buyers can get in touch directly.

Key Features:

User-friendly interface for browsing available books
Ability for sellers to easily list their books and set prices
Direct contact information for buyers and sellers to negotiate and arrange transactions
Focus on GITAM University textbooks to ensure relevance for users

**Technologies Used:**

The website is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. We handled all design, development, and testing ourselves.

How it Works:

Sellers register for an account and create listings for their books, including the title, price, and contact information.
Buyers browse the marketplace, search for specific books, and view details of available listings.
Interested buyers contact sellers directly using the provided contact information to discuss the book and agree on a price.
Buyers and sellers arrange to meet in person to finalize the sale.
