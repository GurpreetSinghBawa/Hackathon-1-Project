                        <h2>Intro</h2>
                        <p>Welcome to Buy/Sell books, your premier online marketplace for buying and selling used books, with a special focus on GITAM University textbooks. Our mission is to connect students, seniors, and juniors in a convenient, transparent way that makes exchanging books easy and affordable.
                            We understand that university textbooks can be a significant expense, and that's why we created this platform. Whether you're looking to purchase a book for an upcoming semester or sell one from a previous year, we're here to help. Our website allows you to browse available books, see prices set by the sellers themselves, and connect directly with the owners.</p>

                        <h2>How to use</h2>
                        <p>What sets us apart is our commitment to the GITAM University community. This isn't a generic, used bookstore â€“ it's a platform built by students, for students. We know the specific books you need for your courses, and we've made it easy to find them. From freshman year essentials to specialized texts for upper-level classes, you'll find what you need here.
                            Selling a book is just as straightforward. Simply register your book, set your price, and add your contact information. We'll take care of connecting you with interested buyers. It's a great way to declutter your shelves, make some extra money, and help out your fellow students at the same time.</p>
